# Snake-Xenzia
**A classic arcade-style game created using Python and Turtle Graphics**

Key Features:
1. **Snake Control:** The player controls a snake on the game board, typically using arrow keys (up, down, left, right) or other specified controls.

2. **Game Board:** The game board is a grid-based layout where the snake and food items are positioned. The snake moves continuously in one direction, and the player's goal is to guide it to collect food items.

3. **Food Items:** Randomly placed food items appear on the game board. When the snake consumes a food item, it grows longer, increasing the player's score.

4. **Score:** The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases each time the snake eats food. Players can compete to achieve high scores.

5. **Collision Detection:** The game monitors collisions between the snake and the boundaries of the game board or itself. If the snake collides with the walls or runs into its own body, the game ends.

6. **Game Over:** When the game ends due to a collision, the player is presented with their final score.

7. **Speed Levels:** Some versions of the Snake game may have multiple speed levels that increase the difficulty as the player's score improves.

8. **High Score Records:** The game may store and display high scores from previous sessions, encouraging players to improve their performance.

9. **Challenges:** As the game progresses, the challenge increases with the snake growing longer, making it more difficult to navigate and avoid collisions.
